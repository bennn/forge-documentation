# What is a Wheat?

Included in Forge assignments are solution file(s) for each part of the assignment.
These are referred to as _wheats_, and have the `.wheat` file extension.
These _wheats_ allow you to check your understanding of the problem using tests. As long as you can
express your question about the assignment as a test, you can receive an authorotative answer from the wheat!

To run tests in your test file (e.g. `stacks.test.frg`) using the wheat solution, follow these steps:

- Replace `open` statements to your implementation file (ex. `stacks.frg`) with the associated wheat.
  For example, you may replace `open "stacks.frg"` with `open "stacks.wheat"`. _Ensure not open both files at the same time._
- Run your tests file in Racket. All associated tests will be run against the _wheat_ instead of your implementation.

_Wheats_ only implement top level predicates of a project. Tests that deal with the specific internals of _your_ implementation
will not be able to be run against the wheat.

# Test Writing Strategies

We have found the following testing-writing stratgies useful when interacting with the wheat.
These are recommendations, you do not **have** to follow these strategies!

## Strategy 1

1. Write example behaviors that you believe the wheat would allow and non-examples that the wheat would rule out in terms of Forgeâ€™s example syntax.
   1. Run your test file to check your examples and non-examples against the wheat. Revise any that fail the check.
2. Study your examples and develop properties that are **necessary** for the wheat to hold. For each property:
   1. Add examples to the test suite for this necessary property, to make sure the property works as you intend.
   1. Using `assert necessary`, check that your property is really less specific than the wheat.
   1. If the property is not less specific than the wheat, add tests to your test-suite to figure out why.
3. Now test that the conjunction of your weak properties is **sufficient** for the wheat.
   1. If this test succeeds, you are done. This conjunction reflects all the characteristics of a correct solution.
   1. If this test fails, Forge will provide you with counter-example(s) illustrating scenarios where all your necessary properties are true, but the wheat is not.
   1. Write some of these counter examples as non-examples of the wheat. Return to step 2
