# Formulas

_Formulas_ are a type of Forge syntax. Given an instance, every formula evaluates to a boolean value. If the formula is true of an instance, we say that the instance _satisfies_ the formula.

<!-- We will talk about _expressions_ after covering formulas, but you will see expressions (`<expr>`)
while we discuss formulas.  -->
