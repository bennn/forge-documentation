# Expressions

_Expressions_ are a type of Forge syntax.  Given an instance, every expression evaluates to an object or set of objects. In the `froglet` sublanguage, expressions are limited to improve error-checking and reduce reliance on the relational algebra that the solver engine uses and the full `forge` language includes.
