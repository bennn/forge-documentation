Forge is a lightweight modeling language, similar to [Alloy](https://alloytools.org), that has been designed for _teaching_ modeling and lightweight formal methods. It comprises three sublanguages or modes:

- **Froglet** (`#lang forge/bsl`), a core language for modeling using object-oriented intuitions;
- **Forge** (`#lang forge`), an extension of Frglet to include relations and relational operators;
- **Temporal Forge**, an extension of Forge to include linear-temporal operators (akin to Alloy 6 or [Electrum](https://github.com/haslab/Electrum)).

Students progress through this language hierarchy as new concepts are introduced in class; this lets the course avoid a steep language-learning curve and cover important practical material earlier than would otherwise be possible.

Don't worry about the greyed-out chapters! Those chapters will become available when they become relevant in the course/assignments.
