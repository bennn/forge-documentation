# Constants & Keywords

## Constants

Forge provides a few built-in constants:

- `univ`: the set of all objects in the universe (including `Int`s);
- `none`: the empty set (of arity 1);
- `iden`: the identity relation (a total function from all objects in the universe to themselves, including `Ints`);
- `Int`: the set of available integer objects. By default it contains `-8` to `7` inclusive, since the default bitwidth is `4`. See \[Integers|Integers] for more information.

## Keywords

The following is a list of keywords in Forge that may not be used as names for relations, sigs, predicates, and runs.
